// Life in Weeks Coding Exercise
// I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

// In this challenge, you are going to create a function that tells us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

function lifeInWeeks(age) {
    
    /************Don't change the code above************/    
        
        //Write your code here.
      // var numberofAge = prompt("Enter your age here");
      
      var RemainigYears = 90 - age;
      var days = RemainigYears * 365;
      var weeks = RemainigYears * 52;
      var years = RemainigYears * 12; 
      
      alert("here is the output days: " + days + " weeks: " + weeks + " years " + years  ); 
        
        
    /*************Don't change the code below**********/
    }
    
 lifeInWeeks(12);
